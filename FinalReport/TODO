TODO:
====================
Add new section 3:	Annotations:	
	List hard examples.
		Wei Chen paper, (show two example papers)
	Discuss the source of the affiliation feature.
	Find another interesting example of two publications that are the same person but hard to calc.

Feature Discussion:
====================
Show advantage of using string similarity to exact matchings.
Show advantage of temporal: (if none, discuss more annotations)
Why venue features fail:
	mean, median. Two histograms (dist for true, dist for false)
Describe intuition behind using coauthor features 
Statistics on coauthor features. Also add histogram of values.


Experimental Evaluation
====================
Output B3 MUC on training and testing. 
Can output the score for each feature as well as the aggregate.
